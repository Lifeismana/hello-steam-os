 Open an encoded file using the given mode and return\n        a wrapped version providing transparent encoding/decoding.\n\n        Note: The wrapped version will only accept the object format\n        defined by the codecs, i.e. Unicode objects for most builtin\n        codecs. Output is also codec dependent and will usually be\n        Unicode as well.\n\n        If encoding is not None, then the\n        underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode.\n        The default file mode is 'r', meaning to open the file in read mode.\n\n        encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the\n        file.\n\n        errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults\n        to 'strict' which causes ValueErrors to be raised in case an\n        encoding error occurs.\n\n        buffering has the same meaning as for the builtin open() API.\n        It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will\n        be used.\n\n        The returned wrapped file object provides an extra attribute\n        .encoding which allows querying the used encoding. This\n        attribute is only available if an encoding was specified as\n        parameter.\n\n

 StreamReaderWriter instances allow wrapping streams which\n        work in both read and write modes.\n\n        The design is such that one can use the factory functions\n        returned by the codec.lookup() function to construct the\n        instance.\n\n    
 StreamRecoder instances translate data from one encoding to another.\n\n        They use the complete set of APIs returned by the\n        codecs.lookup() function to implement their task.\n\n        Data written to the StreamRecoder is first decoded into an\n        intermediate format (depending on the "decode" codec) and then\n        written to the underlying stream using an instance of the provided\n        Writer class.\n\n        In the other direction, data is read from the underlying stream using\n        a Reader instance and then encoded and returned to the caller.\n\n

A lock object is a synchronization primitive.  To create a lock,\ncall threading.Lock().  Methods are:\n\nacquire() -- lock the lock, possibly blocking until it can be obtained\nrelease() -- unlock of the lock\nlocked() -- test whether the lock is currently locked\n\nA lock is not owned by the thread that locked it; another thread may\nunlock it.  A thread attempting to lock a lock that it has already locked\nwill block until another thread unlocks it.  Deadlocks may ensue.

Abstract base class for generic types.\n\nOn Python 3.12 and newer, generic classes implicitly inherit from\nGeneric when they declare a parameter list after the class's name::\n\n    class Mapping[KT, VT]:\n        def __getitem__(self, key: KT) -> VT:\n            ...\n        # Etc.\n\nOn older versions of Python, however, generic classes have to\nexplicitly inherit from Generic.\n\nAfter a class has been declared to be generic, it can then be used as\nfollows::\n\n    def lookup_name[KT, VT](mapping: Mapping[KT, VT], key: KT, default: VT) -> VT:\n        try:\n            return mapping[key]\n        except KeyError:\n            return default\n
Abstract base class for implementing the file system path protocol.
Abstract base class for time zone info objects.
Abstract classes can override this to customize issubclass().\n\nThis is invoked early on by abc.ABCMeta.__subclasscheck__().\nIt should return True, False or NotImplemented.  If it returns\nNotImplemented, the normal algorithm is used.  Otherwise, it\noverrides the normal algorithm (and the outcome is cached).\n

Append module search paths for third-party packages to sys.path.\n\n****************************************************************\n* This module is automatically imported during initialization. *\n****************************************************************\n\nThis will append site-specific paths to the module search path.  On\nUnix (including Mac OSX), it starts with sys.prefix and\nsys.exec_prefix (if different) and appends\nlib/python<version>/site-packages.\nOn other platforms (such as Windows), it tries each of the\nprefixes directly, as well as with lib/site-packages appended.  The\nresulting directories, if they exist, are appended to sys.path, and\nalso inspected for path configuration files.\n\nIf a file named "pyvenv.cfg" exists one directory above sys.executable,\nsys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to that directory and\nit is also checked for site-packages (sys.base_prefix and\nsys.base_exec_prefix will always be the "real" prefixes of the Python\ninstallation). If "pyvenv.cfg" (a bootstrap configuration file) contains\nthe key "include-system-site-packages" set to anything other than "false"\n(case-insensitive), the system-level prefixes will still also be\nsearched for site-packages; otherwise they won't.\n\nAll of the resulting site-specific directories, if they exist, are\nappended to sys.path, and also inspected for path configuration\nfiles.\n\nA path configuration file is a file whose name has the form\n<package>.pth; its contents are additional directories (one per line)\nto be added to sys.path.  Non-existing directories (or\nnon-directories) are never added to sys.path; no directory is added to\nsys.path more than once.  Blank lines and lines beginning with\n'#' are skipped. Lines starting with 'import' are executed.\n\nFor example, suppose sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to\n/usr/local and there is a directory /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages\nwith three subdirectories, foo, bar and spam, and two path\nconfiguration files, foo.pth and bar.pth.  Assume foo.pth contains the\nfollowing:\n\n  # foo package configuration\n  foo\n  bar\n  bletch\n\nand bar.pth contains:\n\n  # bar package configuration\n  bar\n\nThen the following directories are added to sys.path, in this order:\n\n  /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/bar\n  /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/foo\n\nNote that bletch is omitted because it doesn't exist; bar precedes foo\nbecause bar.pth comes alphabetically before foo.pth; and spam is\nomitted because it is not mentioned in either path configuration file.\n\nThe readline module is also automatically configured to enable\ncompletion for systems that support it.  This can be overridden in\nsitecustomize, usercustomize or PYTHONSTARTUP.  Starting Python in\nisolated mode (-I) disables automatic readline configuration.\n\nAfter these operations, an attempt is made to import a module\nnamed sitecustomize, which can perform arbitrary additional\nsite-specific customizations.  If this import fails with an\nImportError exception, it is silently ignored.\n

CSV dialect\n\nThe Dialect type records CSV parsing and generation options.\n
CSV parsing and writing.\n\nThis module provides classes that assist in the reading and writing\nof Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and implements the interface\ndescribed by PEP 305.  Although many CSV files are simple to parse,\nthe format is not formally defined by a stable specification and\nis subtle enough that parsing lines of a CSV file with something\nlike line.split(",") is bound to fail.  The module supports three\nbasic APIs: reading, writing, and registration of dialects.\n\n\nDIALECT REGISTRATION:\n\nReaders and writers support a dialect argument, which is a convenient\nhandle on a group of settings.  When the dialect argument is a string,\nit identifies one of the dialects previously registered with the module.\nIf it is a class or instance, the attributes of the argument are used as\nthe settings for the reader or writer:\n\n    class excel:\n        delimiter = ','\n        quotechar = '"'\n        escapechar = None\n        doublequote = True\n        skipinitialspace = False\n        lineterminator = '\r\n'\n        quoting = QUOTE_MINIMAL\n\nSETTINGS:\n\n    * quotechar - specifies a one-character string to use as the\n        quoting character.  It defaults to '"'.\n    * delimiter - specifies a one-character string to use as the\n        field separator.  It defaults to ','.\n    * skipinitialspace - specifies how to interpret spaces which\n        immediately follow a delimiter.  It defaults to False, which\n        means that spaces immediately following a delimiter is part\n        of the following field.\n    * lineterminator -  specifies the character sequence which should\n        terminate rows.\n    * quoting - controls when quotes should be generated by the writer.\n        It can take on any of the following module constants:\n\n        csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL means only when required, for example, when a\n            field contains either the quotechar or the delimiter\n        csv.QUOTE_ALL means that quotes are always placed around fields.\n        csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC means that quotes are always placed around\n            fields which do not parse as integers or floating point\n            numbers.\n        csv.QUOTE_STRINGS means that quotes are always placed around\n            fields which are strings.  Note that the Python value None\n            is not a string.\n        csv.QUOTE_NOTNULL means that quotes are only placed around fields\n            that are not the Python value None.\n        csv.QUOTE_NONE means that quotes are never placed around fields.\n    * escapechar - specifies a one-character string used to escape\n        the delimiter when quoting is set to QUOTE_NONE.\n    * doublequote - controls the handling of quotes inside fields.  When\n        True, two consecutive quotes are interpreted as one during read,\n        and when writing, each quote character embedded in the data is\n        written as two quotes\n
CSV reader\n\nReader objects are responsible for reading and parsing tabular data\nin CSV format.\n
CSV writer\n\nWriter objects are responsible for generating tabular data\nin CSV format from sequence input.\n

Directory tree generator.\n\n    For each directory in the directory tree rooted at top (including top\n    itself, but excluding '.' and '..'), yields a 3-tuple\n\n        dirpath, dirnames, filenames\n\n    dirpath is a string, the path to the directory.  dirnames is a list of\n    the names of the subdirectories in dirpath (including symlinks to directories,\n    and excluding '.' and '..').\n    filenames is a list of the names of the non-directory files in dirpath.\n    Note that the names in the lists are just names, with no path components.\n    To get a full path (which begins with top) to a file or directory in\n    dirpath, do os.path.join(dirpath, name).\n\n    If optional arg 'topdown' is true or not specified, the triple for a\n    directory is generated before the triples for any of its subdirectories\n    (directories are generated top down).  If topdown is false, the triple\n    for a directory is generated after the triples for all of its\n    subdirectories (directories are generated bottom up).\n\n    When topdown is true, the caller can modify the dirnames list in-place\n    (e.g., via del or slice assignment), and walk will only recurse into the\n    subdirectories whose names remain in dirnames; this can be used to prune the\n    search, or to impose a specific order of visiting.  Modifying dirnames when\n    topdown is false has no effect on the behavior of os.walk(), since the\n    directories in dirnames have already been generated by the time dirnames\n    itself is generated.

Note that the filename is available as the\n    filename attribute of the exception object.\n\n    By default, os.walk does not follow symbolic links to subdirectories on\n    systems that support them.  In order to get this functionality, set the\n    optional argument 'followlinks' to true.\n\n    Caution:  if you pass a relative pathname for top, don't change the\n    current working directory between resumptions of walk.  walk never\n    changes the current directory, and assumes that the client doesn't\n    either.\n\n    Example:\n\n    import os\n    from os.path import join, getsize\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk('python/Lib/email'):\n        print(root, "consumes ")\n        print(sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files), end=" ")\n        print("bytes in", len(files), "non-directory files")\n        if 'CVS' in dirs:\n            dirs.remove('CVS')  # don't visit CVS directories\n\n

Environment variables that change behavior:\nPYTHONSTARTUP: file executed on interactive startup (no default)\nPYTHONPATH   : '%lc'-separated list of directories prefixed to the\n               default module search path.  The result is sys.path.\nPYTHONHOME   : alternate <prefix> directory (or <prefix>%lc<exec_prefix>).\n               The default module search path uses %s.\nPYTHONPLATLIBDIR : override sys.platlibdir.\nPYTHONCASEOK : ignore case in 'import' statements (Windows).\nPYTHONUTF8: if set to 1, enable the UTF-8 mode.\nPYTHONIOENCODING: Encoding[:errors] used for stdin/stdout/stderr.\nPYTHONFAULTHANDLER: dump the Python traceback on fatal errors.\nPYTHONHASHSEED: if this variable is set to 'random', a random value is used\n   to seed the hashes of str and bytes objects.  It can also be set to an\n   integer in the range [0,4294967295] to get hash values with a\n   predictable seed.\nPYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS: limits the maximum digit characters in an int value\n   when converting from a string and when converting an int back to a str.\n   A value of 0 disables the limit.  Conversions to or from bases 2, 4, 8,\n   16, and 32 are never limited.\nPYTHONMALLOC: set the Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks\n   on Python memory allocators. Use PYTHONMALLOC=debug to install debug\n   hooks.\nPYTHONCOERCECLOCALE: if this variable is set to 0, it disables the locale\n   coercion behavior. Use PYTHONCOERCECLOCALE=warn to request display of\n   locale coercion and locale compatibility warnings on stderr.\nPYTHONBREAKPOINT: if this variable is set to 0, it disables the default\n   debugger. It can be set to the callable of your debugger of choice.\nPYTHONDEVMODE: enable the development mode.\nPYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX: root directory for bytecode cache (pyc) files.\nPYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING: enable opt-in EncodingWarning for 'encoding=None'.\nPYTHONNODEBUGRANGES: If this variable is set, it disables the inclusion of the \n   tables mapping extra location information (end line, start column offset \n   and end column offset) to every instruction in code objects. This is useful \n   when smaller code objects and pyc files are desired as well as suppressing the \n   extra visual location indicators when the interpreter displays tracebacks.\nThese variables have equivalent command-line parameters (see --help for details):\nPYTHONDEBUG             : enable parser debug mode (-d)\nPYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE : don't write .pyc files (-B)\nPYTHONINSPECT           : inspect interactively after running script (-i)\nPYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS   : limit max digit characters in an int value\n                          (-X int_max_str_digits=number)\nPYTHONNOUSERSITE        : disable user site directory (-s)\nPYTHONOPTIMIZE          : enable level 1 optimizations (-O)\nPYTHONSAFEPATH          : don't prepend a potentially unsafe path to sys.path (-P)\nPYTHONUNBUFFERED        : disable stdout/stderr buffering (-u)\nPYTHONVERBOSE           : trace import statements (-v)\nPYTHONWARNINGS=arg      : warning control (-W arg)\n

FileIO
FileIO(file, mode='r', closefd=True, opener=None)\n--\n\nOpen a file.\n\nThe mode can be 'r' (default), 'w', 'x' or 'a' for reading,\nwriting, exclusive creation or appending.  The file will be created if it\ndoesn't exist when opened for writing or appending; it will be truncated\nwhen opened for writing.  A FileExistsError will be raised if it already\nexists when opened for creating. Opening a file for creating implies\nwriting so this mode behaves in a similar way to 'w'.Add a '+' to the mode\nto allow simultaneous reading and writing. A custom opener can be used by\npassing a callable as *opener*. The underlying file descriptor for the file\nobject is then obtained by calling opener with (*name*, *flags*).\n*opener* must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as *opener*\nresults in functionality similar to passing None).

FlushKey
FlushKey($module, key, /)\n--\n\nWrites all the attributes of a key to the registry.\n\n  key\n    An already open key, or any one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.\n\nIt is not necessary to call FlushKey to change a key.  Registry changes\nare flushed to disk by the registry using its lazy flusher.  Registry\nchanges are also flushed to disk at system shutdown.  Unlike\nCloseKey(), the FlushKey() method returns only when all the data has\nbeen written to the registry.\n\nAn application should only call FlushKey() if it requires absolute\ncertainty that registry changes are on disk.  If you don't know whether\na FlushKey() call is required, it probably isn't.

Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).\n\nHeaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for\nall k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,\nnon-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting\nproperty of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.\n\nUsage:\n\nheap = []            # creates an empty heap\nheappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap\nitem = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item from the heap\nitem = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it\nheapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, in linear time\nitem = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops and returns smallest item, and adds\n                               # new item; the heap size is unchanged\n\nOur API differs from textbook heap algorithms as follows:\n\n- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the\n  index for a node and the indexes for its children slightly less\n  obvious, but is more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.\n\n- Our heappop() method returns the smallest item, not the largest.\n\nThese two make it possible to view the heap as a regular Python list\nwithout surprises: heap[0] is the smallest item, and heap.sort()\nmaintains the heap invariant!\n

When used with decoder=None, it expects unicode strings as\ndecode input and translates newlines without first invoking an external\ndecoder.

OS routines for NT or Posix depending on what system we're on.\n\nThis exports:\n  - all functions from posix or nt, e.g. unlink, stat, etc.\n  - os.path is either posixpath or ntpath\n  - os.name is either 'posix' or 'nt'\n  - os.curdir is a string representing the current directory (always '.')\n  - os.pardir is a string representing the parent directory (always '..')\n  - os.sep is the (or a most common) pathname separator ('/' or '\\')\n  - os.extsep is the extension separator (always '.')\n  - os.altsep is the alternate pathname separator (None or '/')\n  - os.pathsep is the component separator used in $PATH etc\n  - os.linesep is the line separator in text files ('\r' or '\n' or '\r\n')\n  - os.defpath is the default search path for executables\n  - os.devnull is the file path of the null device ('/dev/null', etc.)\n\nPrograms that import and use 'os' stand a better chance of being\nportable between different platforms.  Of course, they must then\nonly use functions that are defined by all platforms (e.g., unlink\nand opendir), and leave all pathname manipulation to os.path\n(e.g., split and join).\n

Parameter specification variable.\n\nThe preferred way to construct a parameter specification is via the\ndedicated syntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases,\nwhere the use of '**' creates a parameter specification::\n\n    type IntFunc[**P] = Callable[P, int]\n\nFor compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, ParamSpec objects\ncan also be created as follows::\n\n    P = ParamSpec('P')\n\nParameter specification variables exist primarily for the benefit of\nstatic type checkers.  They are used to forward the parameter types of\none callable to another callable, a pattern commonly found in\nhigher-order functions and decorators.  They are only valid when used\nin ``Concatenate``, or as the first argument to ``Callable``, or as\nparameters for user-defined Generics. See class Generic for more\ninformation on generic types.\n\nAn example for annotating a decorator::\n\n    def add_logging[**P, T](f: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:\n        '''A type-safe decorator to add logging to a function.'''\n        def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:\n            logging.info(f'{f.__name__} was called')\n            return f(*args, **kwargs)\n        return inner\n\n    @add_logging\n    def add_two(x: float, y: float) -> float:\n        '''Add two numbers together.'''\n        return x + y\n\nParameter specification variables can be introspected. e.g.::\n\n    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")\n    >>> P.__name__\n    'P'\n\nNote that only parameter specification variables defined in the global\nscope can be pickled.\n
Parameterizes a generic class.\n\nAt least, parameterizing a generic class is the *main* thing this\nmethod does. For example, for some generic class `Foo`, this is called\nwhen we do `Foo[int]` - there, with `cls=Foo` and `params=int`.\n\nHowever, note that this method is also called when defining generic\nclasses in the first place with `class Foo[T]: ...`.\n

Pickler
Pickler(file, protocol=None, fix_imports=True, buffer_callback=None)\n--\n\nThis takes a binary file for writing a pickle data stream.\n\nThe optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given\nprotocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default\nprotocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible\nwith previous versions.\n\nSpecifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol\nversion supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the\nversion of Python needed to read the pickle produced.\n\nThe *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single\nbytes argument. It can thus be a file object opened for binary\nwriting, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets\nthis interface.\n\nIf *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try\nto map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python\n2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.\n\nIf *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are\nserialized into *file* as part of the pickle stream.\n\nIf *buffer_callback* is not None, then it can be called any number\nof times with a buffer view.  If the callback returns a false value\n(such as None), the given buffer is out-of-band; otherwise the\nbuffer is serialized in-band, i.e. inside the pickle stream.\n\nIt is an error if *buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol*\nis None or smaller than 5.

PyHKEY Object - A Python object, representing a win32 registry key.\n\nThis object wraps a Windows HKEY object, automatically closing it when\nthe object is destroyed.  To guarantee cleanup, you can call either\nthe Close() method on the PyHKEY, or the CloseKey() method.\n\nAll functions which accept a handle object also accept an integer --\nhowever, use of the handle object is encouraged.\n\nFunctions:\nClose() - Closes the underlying handle.\nDetach() - Returns the integer Win32 handle, detaching it from the object\n\nProperties:\nhandle - The integer Win32 handle.\n\nOperations:\n__bool__ - Handles with an open object return true, otherwise false.\n__int__ - Converting a handle to an integer returns the Win32 handle.\nrich comparison - Handle objects are compared using the handle value.

QueryInfoKey
QueryInfoKey($module, key, /)\n--\n\nReturns information about a key.\n\n  key\n    An already open key, or any one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.\n\nThe result is a tuple of 3 items:\nAn integer that identifies the number of sub keys this key has.\nAn integer that identifies the number of values this key has.\nAn integer that identifies when the key was last modified (if available)\nas 100's of nanoseconds since Jan 1, 1600.
QueryPerformanceCounter

QueryPerformanceFrequency

QueryReflectionKey
QueryReflectionKey($module, key, /)\n--\n\nReturns the reflection state for the specified key as a bool.\n\n  key\n    An already open key, or any one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.\n\nWill generally raise NotImplementedError if executed on a 32bit OS.
QueryValue
QueryValue($module, key, sub_key, /)\n--\n\nRetrieves the unnamed value for a key.\n\n  key\n    An already open key, or any one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.\n  sub_key\n    A string that holds the name of the subkey with which the value\n    is associated.  If this parameter is None or empty, the function\n    retrieves the value set by the SetValue() method for the key\n    identified by key.\n\nValues in the registry have name, type, and data components. This method\nretrieves the data for a key's first value that has a NULL name.\nBut since the underlying API call doesn't return the type, you'll\nprobably be happier using QueryValueEx; this function is just here for\ncompleteness.
QueryValueEx
QueryValueEx($module, key, name, /)\n--\n\nRetrieves the type and value of a specified sub-key.\n\n  key\n    An already open key, or any one of the predefined HKEY_* constants.\n  name\n    A string indicating the value to query.\n\nBehaves mostly like QueryValue(), but also returns the type of the\nspecified value name associated with the given open registry key.\n\nThe return value is a tuple of the value and the type_id.

Recalculate the set of abstract methods of an abstract class.\n\n    If a class has had one of its abstract methods implemented after the\n    class was created, the method will not be considered implemented until\n    this function is called. Alternatively, if a new abstract method has been\n    added to the class, it will only be considered an abstract method of the\n    class after this function is called.\n\n    This function should be called before any use is made of the class,\n    usually in class decorators that add methods to the subject class.\n\n    Returns cls, to allow usage as a class decorator.\n\n    If cls is not an instance of ABCMeta, does nothing.\n

TextIOWrapper(buffer, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None,\n              line_buffering=False, write_through=False)\n--\n\nCharacter and line based layer over a BufferedIOBase object, buffer.\n\nencoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be\ndecoded or encoded with. It defaults to locale.getencoding().\n\nerrors determines the strictness of encoding and decoding (see\nhelp(codecs.Codec) or the documentation for codecs.register) and\ndefaults to "strict".\n\nnewline controls how line endings are handled. It can be None, '',\n'\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as follows:\n\n* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is\n  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and\n  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the\n  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line\n  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of\n  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given\n  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n\n* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are\n  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If\n  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any\n  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated\n  to the given string.\n\nIf line_buffering is True, a call to flush is implied when a call to\nwrite contains a newline character.

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\n
The abstract base class for all I/O classes.\n\nThis class provides dummy implementations for many methods that\nderived classes can override selectively; the default implementations\nrepresent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.\n\nEven though IOBase does not declare read, readinto, or write because\ntheir signatures will vary, implementations and clients should\nconsider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations\nmay raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are\ncalled.\n\nThe basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is\nbytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.\nIn some cases (such as readinto), a writable object is required. Text\nI/O classes work with str data.\n\nNote that calling any method (except additional calls to close(),\nwhich are ignored) on a closed stream should raise a ValueError.\n\nIOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning\nthat an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a\nstream.\n\nIOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,\nfp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:\n\nwith open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:\n    fp.write('Spam and eggs!')\n
The amount of space in bytes that the array would use in\n a contiguous representation.
The args for a ParamSpec object.\n\nGiven a ParamSpec object P, P.args is an instance of ParamSpecArgs.\n\nParamSpecArgs objects have a reference back to their ParamSpec::\n\n    >>> P = ParamSpec("P")\n    >>> P.args.__origin__ is P\n    True\n\nThis type is meant for runtime introspection and has no special meaning\nto static type checkers.\n

The following implementation-specific options are available:\n\n-X faulthandler: enable faulthandler\n\n-X showrefcount: output the total reference count and number of used\n    memory blocks when the program finishes or after each statement in the\n    interactive interpreter. This only works on debug builds\n\n-X tracemalloc: start tracing Python memory allocations using the\n    tracemalloc module. By default, only the most recent frame is stored in a\n    traceback of a trace. Use -X tracemalloc=NFRAME to start tracing with a\n    traceback limit of NFRAME frames\n\n-X importtime: show how long each import takes. It shows module name,\n    cumulative time (including nested imports) and self time (excluding\n    nested imports). Note that its output may be broken in multi-threaded\n    application. Typical usage is python3 -X importtime -c 'import asyncio'\n\n-X dev: enable CPython's "development mode", introducing additional runtime\n    checks which are too expensive to be enabled by default. Effect of the\n    developer mode:\n       * Add default warning filter, as -W default\n       * Install debug hooks on memory allocators: see the PyMem_SetupDebugHooks()\n         C function\n       * Enable the faulthandler module to dump the Python traceback on a crash\n       * Enable asyncio debug mode\n       * Set the dev_mode attribute of sys.flags to True\n       * io.IOBase destructor logs close() exceptions\n\n-X utf8: enable UTF-8 mode for operating system interfaces, overriding the default\n    locale-aware mode. -X utf8=0 explicitly disables UTF-8 mode (even when it would\n    otherwise activate automatically)\n\n-X pycache_prefix=PATH: enable writing .pyc files to a parallel tree rooted at the\n    given directory instead of to the code tree\n\n-X warn_default_encoding: enable opt-in EncodingWarning for 'encoding=None'\n\n-X no_debug_ranges: disable the inclusion of the tables mapping extra location \n   information (end line, start column offset and end column offset) to every \n   instruction in code objects. This is useful when smaller code objects and pyc \n   files are desired as well as suppressing the extra visual location indicators \n   when the interpreter displays tracebacks.\n\n-X perf: activate support for the Linux "perf" profiler by activating the "perf"\n    trampoline. When this option is activated, the Linux "perf" profiler will be \n    able to report Python calls. This option is only available on some platforms and will \n    do nothing if is not supported on the current system. The default value is "off".\n\n-X frozen_modules=[on|off]: whether or not frozen modules should be used.\n   The default is "on" (or "off" if you are running a local build).\n\n-X int_max_str_digits=number: limit the size of int<->str conversions.\n    This helps avoid denial of service attacks when parsing untrusted data.\n    The default is sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits.  0 disables.

This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in\na binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of\nmachine architecture issues.\n\nNot all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects\nwhose value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be\nwritten and read by this module. The following types are supported:\nNone, integers, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays,\ntuples, lists, sets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it\nshould be understood that tuples, lists and dictionaries are only\nsupported as long as the values contained therein are themselves\nsupported; and recursive lists and dictionaries should not be written\n(they will cause infinite loops).\n\nVariables:\n\nversion -- indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the\n    historical format, version 1 shares interned strings and version 2\n    uses a binary format for floating point numbers.\n    Version 3 shares common object references (New in version 3.4).\n\nFunctions:\n\ndump() -- write value to a file\nload() -- read value from a file\ndumps() -- marshal value as a bytes object\nloads() -- read value from a bytes-like object
This module defines an object type which can efficiently represent\nan array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point\nnumbers.  Arrays are sequence types and behave very much like lists,\nexcept that the type of objects stored in them is constrained.\n
This module makes available standard errno system symbols.\n\nThe value of each symbol is the corresponding integer value,\ne.g., on most systems, errno.ENOENT equals the integer 2.\n\nThe dictionary errno.errorcode maps numeric codes to symbol names,\ne.g., errno.errorcode[2] could be the string 'ENOENT'.\n\nSymbols that are not relevant to the underlying system are not defined.\n\nTo map error codes to error messages, use the function os.strerror(),\ne.g. os.strerror(2) could return 'No such file or directory'.
This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex\nnumbers.
This module provides access to operating system functionality that is\nstandardized by the C Standard and the POSIX standard (a thinly\ndisguised Unix interface).  Refer to the library manual and\ncorresponding Unix manual entries for more information on calls.

This module provides primitive operations to manage Python interpreters.\nThe 'interpreters' module provides a more convenient interface.
This module provides primitive operations to write multi-threaded programs.\nThe 'threading' module provides a more convenient interface.
This module provides various functions to manipulate time values.\n\nThere are two standard representations of time.  One is the number\nof seconds since the Epoch, in UTC (a.k.a. GMT).  It may be an integer\nor a floating point number (to represent fractions of seconds).\nThe Epoch is system-defined; on Unix, it is generally January 1st, 1970.\nThe actual value can be retrieved by calling gmtime(0).\n\nThe other representation is a tuple of 9 integers giving local time.\nThe tuple items are:\n  year (including century, e.g. 1998)\n  month (1-12)\n  day (1-31)\n  hours (0-23)\n  minutes (0-59)\n  seconds (0-59)\n  weekday (0-6, Monday is 0)\n  Julian day (day in the year, 1-366)\n  DST (Daylight Savings Time) flag (-1, 0 or 1)\nIf the DST flag is 0, the time is given in the regular time zone;\nif it is 1, the time is given in the DST time zone;\nif it is -1, mktime() should guess based on the date and time.\n

Type alias.\n\nType aliases are created through the type statement::\n\n    type Alias = int\n\nIn this example, Alias and int will be treated equivalently by static\ntype checkers.\n\nAt runtime, Alias is an instance of TypeAliasType. The __name__\nattribute holds the name of the type alias. The value of the type alias\nis stored in the __value__ attribute. It is evaluated lazily, so the\nvalue is computed only if the attribute is accessed.\n\nType aliases can also be generic::\n\n    type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]\n\nIn this case, the type parameters of the alias are stored in the\n__type_params__ attribute.\n\nSee PEP 695 for more information.\n
Type does not define the tp_name field.

Type variable tuple. A specialized form of type variable that enables\nvariadic generics.\n\nThe preferred way to construct a type variable tuple is via the\ndedicated syntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases,\nwhere a single '*' indicates a type variable tuple::\n\n    def move_first_element_to_last[T, *Ts](tup: tuple[T, *Ts]) -> tuple[*Ts, T]:\n        return (*tup[1:], tup[0])\n\nFor compatibility with Python 3.11 and earlier, TypeVarTuple objects\ncan also be created as follows::\n\n    Ts = TypeVarTuple('Ts')  # Can be given any name\n\nJust as a TypeVar (type variable) is a placeholder for a single type,\na TypeVarTuple is a placeholder for an *arbitrary* number of types. For\nexample, if we define a generic class using a TypeVarTuple::\n\n    class C[*Ts]: ...\n\nThen we can parameterize that class with an arbitrary number of type\narguments::\n\n    C[int]       # Fine\n    C[int, str]  # Also fine\n    C[()]        # Even this is fine\n\nFor more details, see PEP 646.\n\nNote that only TypeVarTuples defined in the global scope can be\npickled.\n
Type variable.\n\nThe preferred way to construct a type variable is via the dedicated\nsyntax for generic functions, classes, and type aliases::\n\n    class Sequence[T]:  # T is a TypeVar\n        ...\n\nThis syntax can also be used to create bound and constrained type\nvariables::\n\n    # S is a TypeVar bound to str\n    class StrSequence[S: str]:\n        ...\n\n    # A is a TypeVar constrained to str or bytes\n    class StrOrBytesSequence[A: (str, bytes)]:\n        ...\n\nHowever, if desired, reusable type variables can also be constructed\nmanually, like so::\n\n   T = TypeVar('T')  # Can be anything\n   S = TypeVar('S', bound=str)  # Can be any subtype of str\n   A = TypeVar('A', str, bytes)  # Must be exactly str or bytes\n\nType variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type\ncheckers.  They serve as the parameters for generic types as well\nas for generic function and type alias definitions.\n\nThe variance of type variables is inferred by type checkers when they\nare created through the type parameter syntax and when\n``infer_variance=True`` is passed. Manually created type variables may\nbe explicitly marked covariant or contravariant by passing\n``covariant=True`` or ``contravariant=True``. By default, manually\ncreated type variables are invariant. See PEP 484 and PEP 695 for more\ndetails.\n

Unpickler
Unpickler(file, *, fix_imports=True, encoding='ASCII', errors='strict',\n          buffers=())\n--\n\nThis takes a binary file for reading a pickle data stream.\n\nThe protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no\nprotocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's\nrepresentation are ignored.\n\nThe argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes\nan integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no\narguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a\nbinary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any\nother custom object that meets this interface.\n\nOptional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,\nwhich are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream\ngenerated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to\nmap the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The\n*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string\ninstances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',\nrespectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit\nstring instances as bytes objects.

If length is 0, the maximum length of the map\nwill be the current size of the file when mmap is called.\nflags specifies the nature of the mapping. MAP_PRIVATE creates a\nprivate copy-on-write mapping, so changes to the contents of the mmap\nobject will be private to this process, and MAP_SHARED creates a mapping\nthat's shared with all other processes mapping the same areas of the file.\nThe default value is MAP_SHARED.\n\nTo map anonymous memory, pass -1 as the fileno (both versions).

Can be F_OK to test existence,\n    or the inclusive-OR of R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK.\n  dir_fd\n    If not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,\n    and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that\n    directory.\n  effective_ids\n    If True, access will use the effective uid/gid instead of\n    the real uid/gid.\n  follow_symlinks\n    If False, and the last element of the path is a symbolic link,\n    access will examine the symbolic link itself instead of the file\n    the link points to.\n\ndir_fd, effective_ids, and follow_symlinks may not be implemented\n  on your platform.  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a\n  NotImplementedError.\n\nNote that most operations will use the effective uid/gid, therefore this\n  routine can be used in a suid/sgid environment to test if the invoking user\n  has the specified access to the path.

acquire
acquire(blocking=True) -> bool\n\nLock the lock.  `blocking` indicates whether we should wait\nfor the lock to be available or not.  If `blocking` is False\nand another thread holds the lock, the method will return False\nimmediately.  If `blocking` is True and another thread holds\nthe lock, the method will wait for the lock to be released,\ntake it and then return True.\n(note: the blocking operation is interruptible.)\n\nIn all other cases, the method will return True immediately.\nPrecisely, if the current thread already holds the lock, its\ninternal counter is simply incremented. If nobody holds the lock,\nthe lock is taken and its internal counter initialized to 1.
acquire(blocking=True, timeout=-1) -> bool\n(acquire_lock() is an obsolete synonym)\n\nLock the lock.  Without argument, this blocks if the lock is already\nlocked (even by the same thread), waiting for another thread to release\nthe lock, and return True once the lock is acquired.\nWith an argument, this will only block if the argument is true,\nand the return value reflects whether the lock is acquired.\nThe blocking operation is interruptible.
acquire_lock
acquire_lock($module, /)\n--\n\nAcquires the interpreter's import lock for the current thread.\n\nThis lock should be used by import hooks to ensure thread-safety when importing\nmodules. On platforms without threads, this function does nothing.

array(typecode [, initializer]) -> array\n\nReturn a new array whose items are restricted by typecode, and\ninitialized from the optional initializer value, which must be a list,\nstring or iterable over elements of the appropriate type.\n\nArrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except\nthe type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified\nat object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.\nThe following type codes are defined:\n\n    Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes\n    'b'         signed integer     1\n    'B'         unsigned integer   1\n    'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note)\n    'h'         signed integer     2\n    'H'         unsigned integer   2\n    'i'         signed integer     2\n    'I'         unsigned integer   2\n    'l'         signed integer     4\n    'L'         unsigned integer   4\n    'q'         signed integer     8 (see note)\n    'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note)\n    'f'         floating point     4\n    'd'         floating point     8\n\nNOTE: The 'u' typecode corresponds to Python's unicode character. On\nnarrow builds this is 2-bytes on wide builds this is 4-bytes.\n\nNOTE: The 'q' and 'Q' type codes are only available if the platform\nC compiler used to build Python supports 'long long', or, on Windows,\n'__int64'.\n\nMethods:\n\nappend() -- append a new item to the end of the array\nbuffer_info() -- return information giving the current memory info\nbyteswap() -- byteswap all the items of the array\ncount() -- return number of occurrences of an object\nextend() -- extend array by appending multiple elements from an iterable\nfromfile() -- read items from a file object\nfromlist() -- append items from the list\nfrombytes() -- append items from the string\nindex() -- return index of first occurrence of an object\ninsert() -- insert a new item into the array at a provided position\npop() -- remove and return item (default last)\nremove() -- remove first occurrence of an object\nreverse() -- reverse the order of the items in the array\ntofile() -- write all items to a file object\ntolist() -- return the array converted to an ordinary list\ntobytes() -- return the array converted to a string\n\nAttributes:\n\ntypecode -- the typecode character used to create the array\nitemsize -- the length in bytes of one array item\n

classmethod
classmethod(function) -> method\n\nConvert a function to be a class method.\n\nA class method receives the class as implicit first argument,\njust like an instance method receives the instance.\nTo declare a class method, use this idiom:\n\n  class C:\n      @classmethod\n      def f(cls, arg1, arg2, argN):\n          ...\n\nIt can be called either on the class (e.g. C.f()) or on an instance\n(e.g. C().f()).  The instance is ignored except for its class.\nIf a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class\nobject is passed as the implied first argument.\n\nClass methods are different than C++ or Java static methods.\nIf you want those, see the staticmethod builtin.

dump
dump($module, /, obj, file, protocol=None, *, fix_imports=True,\n     buffer_callback=None)\n--\n\nWrite a pickled representation of obj to the open file object file.\n\nThis is equivalent to ``Pickler(file, protocol).dump(obj)``, but may\nbe more efficient.\n\nThe optional *protocol* argument tells the pickler to use the given\nprotocol; supported protocols are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  The default\nprotocol is 4. It was introduced in Python 3.4, and is incompatible\nwith previous versions.\n\nSpecifying a negative protocol version selects the highest protocol\nversion supported.  The higher the protocol used, the more recent the\nversion of Python needed to read the pickle produced.\n\nThe *file* argument must have a write() method that accepts a single\nbytes argument.  It can thus be a file object opened for binary\nwriting, an io.BytesIO instance, or any other custom object that meets\nthis interface.\n\nIf *fix_imports* is True and protocol is less than 3, pickle will try\nto map the new Python 3 names to the old module names used in Python\n2, so that the pickle data stream is readable with Python 2.\n\nIf *buffer_callback* is None (the default), buffer views are serialized\ninto *file* as part of the pickle stream.  It is an error if\n*buffer_callback* is not None and *protocol* is None or smaller than 5.
dump($module, value, file, version=version, /)\n--\n\nWrite the value on the open file.\n\n  value\n    Must be a supported type.\n  file\n    Must be a writeable binary file.\n  version\n    Indicates the data format that dump should use.\n\nIf the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a\nValueError exception is raised - but garbage data will also be written\nto the file. The object will not be properly read back by load().
dump($self, obj, /)\n--\n\nWrite a pickled representation of the given object to the open file.

load
load($module, /, file, *, fix_imports=True, encoding='ASCII',\n     errors='strict', buffers=())\n--\n\nRead and return an object from the pickle data stored in a file.\n\nThis is equivalent to ``Unpickler(file).load()``, but may be more\nefficient.\n\nThe protocol version of the pickle is detected automatically, so no\nprotocol argument is needed.  Bytes past the pickled object's\nrepresentation are ignored.\n\nThe argument *file* must have two methods, a read() method that takes\nan integer argument, and a readline() method that requires no\narguments.  Both methods should return bytes.  Thus *file* can be a\nbinary file object opened for reading, an io.BytesIO object, or any\nother custom object that meets this interface.\n\nOptional keyword arguments are *fix_imports*, *encoding* and *errors*,\nwhich are used to control compatibility support for pickle stream\ngenerated by Python 2.  If *fix_imports* is True, pickle will try to\nmap the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python 3.  The\n*encoding* and *errors* tell pickle how to decode 8-bit string\ninstances pickled by Python 2; these default to 'ASCII' and 'strict',\nrespectively.  The *encoding* can be 'bytes' to read these 8-bit\nstring instances as bytes objects.
load($module, file, /)\n--\n\nRead one value from the open file and return it.\n\n  file\n    Must be readable binary file.\n\nIf no valid value is read (e.g. because the data has a different Python\nversion's incompatible marshal format), raise EOFError, ValueError or\nTypeError.\n\nNote: If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with\ndump(), load() will substitute None for the unmarshallable type.
load($self, /)\n--\n\nLoad a pickle.\n\nRead a pickled object representation from the open file object given\nin the constructor, and return the reconstituted object hierarchy\nspecified therein.
load() takes no arguments
load_module
load_module(fullname) -> module.\n\n        Load the module specified by 'fullname'. 'fullname' must be the\n        fully qualified (dotted) module name.

ois Pinard]\n\nHeaps are arrays for which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] and a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for\nall k, counting elements from 0.  For the sake of comparison,\nnon-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting\nproperty of a heap is that a[0] is always its smallest element.\n\nThe strange invariant above is meant to be an efficient memory\nrepresentation for a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', not a[k]:\n\n                                   0\n\n                  1                                 2\n\n          3               4                5               6\n\n      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14\n\n    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30\n\n\nIn the tree above, each cell `k' is topping `2*k+1' and `2*k+2'.  In\na usual binary tournament we see in sports, each cell is the winner\nover the two cells it tops, and we can trace the winner down the tree\nto see all opponents s/he had.  However, in many computer applications\nof such tournaments, we do not need to trace the history of a winner.\nTo be more memory efficient, when a winner is promoted, we try to\nreplace it by something else at a lower level, and the rule becomes\nthat a cell and the two cells it tops contain three different items,\nbut the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.\n\nIf this heap invariant is protected at all time, index 0 is clearly\nthe overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and\nfind the "next" winner is to move some loser (let's say cell 30 in the\ndiagram above) into the 0 position, and then percolate this new 0 down\nthe tree, exchanging values, until the invariant is re-established.\nThis is clearly logarithmic on the total number of items in the tree.\nBy iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.\n\nA nice feature of this sort is that you can efficiently insert new\nitems while the sort is going on, provided that the inserted items are\nnot "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is\nespecially useful in simulation contexts, where the tree holds all\nincoming events, and the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled\ntime.  When an event schedule other events for execution, they are\nscheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a\nheap is a good structure for implementing schedulers (this is what I\nused for my MIDI sequencer :-).\n\nVarious structures for implementing schedulers have been extensively\nstudied, and heaps are good for this, as they are reasonably speedy,\nthe speed is almost constant, and the worst case is not much different\nthan the average case.  However, there are other representations which\nare more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.\n\nHeaps are also very useful in big disk sorts.  You most probably all\nknow that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted\nsequences, which size is usually related to the amount of CPU memory),\nfollowed by a merging passes for these runs, which merging is often\nvery cleverly organised[1].  It is very important that the initial\nsort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way\nto that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you\nreplace and percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll\nproduce runs which are twice the size of the memory for random input,\nand much better for input fuzzily ordered.\n\nMoreover, if you output the 0'th item on disk and get an input which\nmay not fit in the current tournament (because the value "wins" over\nthe last output value), it cannot fit in the heap, so the size of the\nheap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately\nfor progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the\nsame rate the first heap is melting.  When the first heap completely\nvanishes, you switch heaps and start a new run.  Clever and quite\neffective!\n\nIn a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in\na few applications, and I think it is good to keep a `heap' module\naround. :-)\n\n--------------------\n[1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are\nmore annoying than clever, and this is a consequence of the seeking\ncapabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big\ntape drives, the story was quite different, and one had to be very\nclever to ensure (far in advance) that each tape movement will be the\nmost effective possible (that is, will best participate at\n"progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read\nbackwards, and this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.\nBelieve me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!\nFrom all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)\n

open
open($module, /, file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None,\n     errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n--\n\nOpen file and return a stream.  Raise OSError upon failure.\n\nfile is either a text or byte string giving the name (and the path\nif the file isn't in the current working directory) of the file to\nbe opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be\nwrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the\nreturned I/O object is closed, unless closefd is set to False.)\n\nmode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file\nis opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text\nmode.  Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if\nit already exists), 'x' for creating and writing to a new file, and\n'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes\nappend to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position).\nIn text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform\ndependent: locale.getencoding() is called to get the current locale encoding.\n(For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding\nunspecified.) The available modes are:\n\n========= ===============================================================\nCharacter Meaning\n--------- ---------------------------------------------------------------\n'r'       open for reading (default)\n'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first\n'x'       create a new file and open it for writing\n'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists\n'b'       binary mode\n't'       text mode (default)\n'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)\n========= ===============================================================\n\nThe default mode is 'rt' (open for reading text). For binary random\naccess, the mode 'w+b' opens and truncates the file to 0 bytes, while\n'r+b' opens the file without truncation. The 'x' mode implies 'w' and\nraises an `FileExistsError` if the file already exists.\n\nPython distinguishes between files opened in binary and text modes,\neven when the underlying operating system doesn't. Files opened in\nbinary mode (appending 'b' to the mode argument) return contents as\nbytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when\n't' is appended to the mode argument), the contents of the file are\nreturned as strings, the bytes having been first decoded using a\nplatform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given.\n\nbuffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy.\nPass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select\nline buffering (only usable in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate\nthe size of a fixed-size chunk buffer.  When no buffering argument is\ngiven, the default buffering policy works as follows:\n\n* Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer\n  is chosen using a heuristic trying to determine the underlying device's\n  "block size" and falling back on `io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.\n  On many systems, the buffer will typically be 4096 or 8192 bytes long.\n\n* "Interactive" text files (files for which isatty() returns True)\n  use line buffering.  Other text files use the policy described above\n  for binary files.\n\nencoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the\nfile. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is\nplatform dependent, but any encoding supported by Python can be\npassed.  See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.\n\nerrors is an optional string that specifies how encoding errors are to\nbe handled---this argument should not be used in binary mode. Pass\n'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error\n(the default of None has the same effect), or pass 'ignore' to ignore\nerrors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss.)\nSee the documentation for codecs.register or run 'help(codecs.Codec)'\nfor a list of the permitted encoding error strings.\n\nnewline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text\nmode). It can be None, '', '\n', '\r', and '\r\n'.  It works as\nfollows:\n\n* On input, if newline is None, universal newlines mode is\n  enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and\n  these are translated into '\n' before being returned to the\n  caller. If it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line\n  endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of\n  the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given\n  string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.\n\n* On output, if newline is None, any '\n' characters written are\n  translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep. If\n  newline is '' or '\n', no translation takes place. If newline is any\n  of the other legal values, any '\n' characters written are translated\n  to the given string.\n\nIf closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open\nwhen the file is closed. This does not work when a file name is given\nand must be True in that case.\n\nA custom opener can be used by passing a callable as *opener*. The\nunderlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by\ncalling *opener* with (*file*, *flags*). *opener* must return an open\nfile descriptor (passing os.open as *opener* results in functionality\nsimilar to passing None).\n\nopen() returns a file object whose type depends on the mode, and\nthrough which the standard file operations such as reading and writing\nare performed. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ('w',\n'r', 'wt', 'rt', etc.), it returns a TextIOWrapper. When used to open\na file in a binary mode, the returned class varies: in read binary\nmode, it returns a BufferedReader; in write binary and append binary\nmodes, it returns a BufferedWriter, and in read/write mode, it returns\na BufferedRandom.\n\nIt is also possible to use a string or bytearray as a file for both\nreading and writing. For strings StringIO can be used like a file\nopened in a text mode, and for bytes a BytesIO can be used like a file\nopened in a binary mode.
open($module, /, path, flags, mode=511, *, dir_fd=None)\n--\n\nOpen a file for low level IO.  Returns a file descriptor (integer).\n\nIf dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,\n  and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.\ndir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.\n  If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
open_code
open_code($module, /, path)\n--\n\nOpens the provided file with the intent to import the contents.\n\nThis may perform extra validation beyond open(), but is otherwise interchangeable\nwith calling open(path, 'rb').
open_osfhandle
open_osfhandle($module, handle, flags, /)\n--\n\nCreate a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle.\n\nThe flags parameter should be a bitwise OR of os.O_APPEND, os.O_RDONLY,\nand os.O_TEXT. The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter\nto os.fdopen() to create a file object.

remove($module, /, path, *, dir_fd=None)\n--\n\nRemove a file (same as unlink()).\n\nIf dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,\n  and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.\ndir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.\n  If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
remove($self, v, /)\n--\n\nRemove the first occurrence of v in the array.
remove($self, value, /)\n--\n\nRemove first occurrence of value.\n\nRaises ValueError if the value is not present.
remove($self, value, /)\n--\n\nRemove the first occurrence of a value in the bytearray.\n\n  value\n    The value to remove.

removedirs
removedirs(name)\n\n    Super-rmdir; remove a leaf directory and all empty intermediate\n    ones.  Works like rmdir except that, if the leaf directory is\n    successfully removed, directories corresponding to rightmost path\n    segments will be pruned away until either the whole path is\n    consumed or an error occurs.  Errors during this latter phase are\n    ignored -- they generally mean that a directory was not empty.\n\n

rename
rename($module, /, src, dst, *, src_dir_fd=None, dst_dir_fd=None)\n--\n\nRename a file or directory.\n\nIf either src_dir_fd or dst_dir_fd is not None, it should be a file\n  descriptor open to a directory, and the respective path string (src or dst)\n  should be relative; the path will then be relative to that directory.\nsrc_dir_fd and dst_dir_fd, may not be implemented on your platform.\n  If they are unavailable, using them will raise a NotImplementedError.
renames
renames(old, new)\n\n    Super-rename; create directories as necessary and delete any left\n    empty.  Works like rename, except creation of any intermediate\n    directories needed to make the new pathname good is attempted\n    first.  After the rename, directories corresponding to rightmost\n    path segments of the old name will be pruned until either the\n    whole path is consumed or a nonempty directory is found.\n\n    Note: this function can fail with the new directory structure made\n    if you lack permissions needed to unlink the leaf directory or\n    file.\n\n

A typical operation is "print".\n\n"arguments" is passed to the application, but should be omitted if the\nfile is a document.\n\n"cwd" is the working directory for the operation. If "filepath" is\nrelative, it will be resolved against this directory. This argument\nshould usually be an absolute path.\n\n"show_cmd" can be used to override the recommended visibility option.\nSee the Windows ShellExecute documentation for values.\n\nstartfile returns as soon as the associated application is launched.\nThere is no option to wait for the application to close, and no way\nto retrieve the application's exit status.\n\nThe filepath is relative to the current directory.  If you want to use\nan absolute path, make sure the first character is not a slash ("/");\nthe underlying Win32 ShellExecute function doesn't work if it is.

truncate($module, /, path, length)\n--\n\nTruncate a file, specified by path, to a specific length.\n\nOn some platforms, path may also be specified as an open file descriptor.\n  If this functionality is unavailable, using it raises an exception.
truncate($self, pos=None, /)\n--\n\n
truncate($self, pos=None, /)\n--\n\nTruncate size to pos.\n\nThe pos argument defaults to the current file position, as\nreturned by tell().  The current file position is unchanged.\nReturns the new absolute position.
truncate($self, size=None, /)\n--\n\nTruncate file to size bytes.\n\nFile pointer is left unchanged. Size defaults to the current IO position\nas reported by tell(). Return the new size.
truncate($self, size=None, /)\n--\n\nTruncate the file to at most size bytes and return the truncated size.\n\nSize defaults to the current file position, as returned by tell().\nThe current file position is changed to the value of size.
truncate($self, size=None, /)\n--\n\nTruncate the file to at most size bytes.\n\nSize defaults to the current file position, as returned by tell().\nThe current file position is unchanged.  Returns the new size.

zip(*iterables, strict=False) --> Yield tuples until an input is exhausted.\n\n   >>> list(zip('abcdefg', range(3), range(4)))\n   [('a', 0, 0), ('b', 1, 1), ('c', 2, 2)]\n\nThe zip object yields n-length tuples, where n is the number of iterables\npassed as positional arguments to zip().  The i-th element in every tuple\ncomes from the i-th iterable argument to zip().  This continues until the\nshortest argument is exhausted.\n\nIf strict is true and one of the arguments is exhausted before the others,\nraise a ValueError.
zip_iterator
zip_longest() got an unexpected keyword argument
zip_longest(iter1 [,iter2 [...]], [fillvalue=None]) --> zip_longest object\n\nReturn a zip_longest object whose .__next__() method returns a tuple where\nthe i-th element comes from the i-th iterable argument.  The .__next__()\nmethod continues until the longest iterable in the argument sequence\nis exhausted and then it raises StopIteration.  When the shorter iterables\nare exhausted, the fillvalue is substituted in their place.  The fillvalue\ndefaults to None or can be specified by a keyword argument.\n

zipimport
zipimport provides support for importing Python modules from Zip archives.\n\nThis module exports three objects:\n- zipimporter: a class; its constructor takes a path to a Zip archive.\n- ZipImportError: exception raised by zipimporter objects. It's a\n  subclass of ImportError, so it can be caught as ImportError, too.\n- _zip_directory_cache: a dict, mapping archive paths to zip directory\n  info dicts, as used in zipimporter._files.\n\nIt is usually not needed to use the zipimport module explicitly; it is\nused by the builtin import mechanism for sys.path items that are paths\nto Zip archives.\n
zipimport.zipimporter.load_module() is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.12; use exec_module() instead

zipimporter(archivepath) -> zipimporter object\n\n    Create a new zipimporter instance. 'archivepath' must be a path to\n    a zipfile, or to a specific path inside a zipfile. For example, it can be\n    '/tmp/myimport.zip', or '/tmp/myimport.zip/mydirectory', if mydirectory is a\n    valid directory inside the archive.\n\n    'ZipImportError is raised if 'archivepath' doesn't point to a valid Zip\n    archive.\n\n    The 'archive' attribute of zipimporter objects contains the name of the\n    zipfile targeted.\n
